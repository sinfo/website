          <h3>The quick version</h3>
          <p>
            SINFO is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
            experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual
            orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
            religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of
            conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is
            not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks,
            workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference
            participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled
            from the conference at the discretion of the conference organisers.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>The less quick version</h3>
          <p>
            We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form and
            we expect all participants to conduct themselves in a professional
            and appropriate manner. Conference participants violating these
            rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference, without a
            refund, at the discretion of the conference organisers. Harassment
            includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of
            domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
            orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age,
            religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
            stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
            disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
            and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any
            harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors are
            also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors
            should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.
            Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
            clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised
            environment.If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the
            conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate,
            including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with
            no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is
            being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member
            of the SINFO staff immediately. SINFO staff can be identified as
            they'll be wearing branded t-shirts. SINFO staff will be happy to
            help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement,
            provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment
            to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your
            attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules at
            conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
